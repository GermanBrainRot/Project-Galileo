## My Interpretation of the Prohibition of Commertial Use

**Intention of this document**: as far as I understand the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, I, Markus Kasperczyk, am the ultimate arbiter whether something that constitues commercial use as defined by the license is to be prosecuted or not - and I retain this right. This document is intended *solely* to clarify under what conditions I intend to enforce the prohibition and when I do not.

**Explicitly allowed cases** (insofar as the share-alike condition is maintained) include, but are not limited to:

- **Research** conducted by **publicly funded institutions**, **independent individuals** or private institutions that (with some good will) could qualify as **research cooperatives** (e.g. SETI)
- **Commercial distribution of results** of research conducted by entities as described above
- Creation and distribution **educational content**
- Explainers in the form of **videos on social media**, for example YouTube - even when monetized

In the last case, a reference to the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license in the video description suffices, and I recommend (for clarity) referencing this document.

**Communicating my ideas in an informal setting** (for example a private post on social media in text form) can happen without referencing the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license - but this does not mean that one could transfer the intellectual content in this way without the terms of the license. The minute the recipient builds on my intellectual property in a formal setting, the license has to be referenced again, naming me as the rights holder.

**I may seek enforcement of the prohibition** in cases such as:

- **Big corporations located in western countries** who use my work to enhance their economic activities (e.g. better manufacturing techniques with the intent of selling the product) or to build completely new products. A more concrete defintion of "big corporation located in western countries" is given below
- **Privately funded research** where the way the research is funded can clearly lead to a conflict of interest between epistemic interests and financial interests

My **working understanding** of "big corporations located in western countries" is directed decomposes as follows:

- **Big**: more than 100 employees (but this is just a guideline)
- **western**: located in the USA *or a country in a military alliance with them*, for example NATO
- **corporation**: any juristic person selling services or commodities
  
  
**Why the West specifically?**

My grudge agains the West is not arbitrary. The West has been the spawning point of globe spanning empires ever since 1492 and it is time for this to end as the rest of the world is catching up. So long as the current global empire - the US and countries geopolitically aligned with them - are politically dominated by the interests of corporations in the above sense (specifically banks, but also some industrial giants) rather than serving primarily the interests of the working class, they will keep making *very* questionable decisions in the name of maximizing shareholder value.

In particular, my conditions apply so long as Israel does not face serious consequences for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank or their hostile actions against other countries in the region in general. Additionally, before I consider lifting this intellectual embargo, I require that the most powerful big corporations in the west - specifically banks - come under public control and that the political establishment be completely replaced by governments of by and for the workers (and *small* businesses).


**I explicitly encourage** developing countries and the People's Republic of China to make use of my work in whichever way they see fit. Also, if Russia can pull off finding military applications of this work, I encourage them to do so. While I do not condone the fact that they started the war in Ukraine, It is my opinion that they were provoked by NATO and that it is NATO who keeps the war going - and as the exclusive holder of the rights to the intellectual content of this work, I am unwilling to move a millimeter away from this position.
