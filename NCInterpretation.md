## My Interpretation of the Prohibition of Commercial Use

It would appear that you can not own a general idea - only the specific expression of an idea or a specific technical application. This would appear to directly contradict the western narrative that "the Chinese are stealing our ideas" and so on, as if the know-how transfer hadn't been infinitely more valuable than this or that brand whose aesthetics may have been imitated here or there.

This observation reduces the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 on this theoretical framework to a sophisticated attempt at trolling. It could have been fun to make big western corporations argue that you can't own ideas in courts, but probably an expensive and time-consuming type of fun. So, just go ahead and use my ideas.

Should I find that some big bank is so intellectually lazy that they somehow used one of my formulations unaltered or only modified rather than reformulated in their own words, I may still choose to pursue enforcement of my rights.
