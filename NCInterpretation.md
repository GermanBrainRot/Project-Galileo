## My Interpretation of the Prohibition of Commertial Use

**Intention of this document**: as far as I understand the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, I, Markus Kasperczyk, am the ultimate arbiter whether something constitutes commercial use or not - and I retain this right. This document is intended *solely* to clarify under what conditions I intend to enforce the prohibition and when I do not.

**Explicitly allowed cases** (insofar as the share-alike condition is maintained) include, but are not limited to:

- Research and distribution of results
- Creation and distribution educational content
- Explainers in the form of videos on social media, for example YouTube

In the last case, a reference to the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license in the video description suffices, and I recommend (for clarity) referencing this document.

**Communicating my ideas in an informal setting** (for example a private post on social media in text form) can happen without referencing the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license - but this does not mean that one could transfer the intellectual content in this way without the terms of the license. The minute the recipient builds on my intellectual property, the license has to be referenced again, naming me as the rights holder.

**I explicitly encourage** developing countries and the People's Republic of China to make use of my work in whichever way they see fit.

**I may seek enforcement of the prohibition** specifically against big (>100 employees) western (located in the USA or a country in a military alliance with them, for example NATO) economic entities so long as these countries are politically dominated by the interests of these corporations rather than serving primarily the interests of the working class. In particular, these conditions apply so long as Israel does not face serious consequences for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank or their hostile actions against other countries in the region in general. Additionally, before I consider lifting this embargo, I require that the most powerful big corporations in the west - specifically banks - come under public control and that the political establishment be completely replaced by governments of by and for the workers (and *small* businesses).
