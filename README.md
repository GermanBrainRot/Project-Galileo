# The Galilean Moment of Quantum Mechanics

## Back to Materialism!

!!! Attention: This work is still in refinement stage until 23rd or September 2025. After this, I hope I can limit myself to minor revisions and pointers to other contributions. Until then, everything you read is provisional !!!

In this publication, I will discuss Carlo Rovelli's Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) and how it aims at resolving the measurement problem. Once I have explained how I think it works, I will point out an obvious type of criticism and how Rovelli tried to fix the problem. After this, I will show why it does not fix the issues, suggest a *much* better fix and discuss why, in my opinion, academia missed this despite being obvious and how this is just the tip of the iceberg of much more fundamental problems with western society.

In [1996/97, Carlo Rovelli](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9609002) introduced the idea that descriptions of quantum systems could be observer-dependent. Here, "observer" does not refer to any "conscious" or "macroscopic" entity, but returns to the more sober and naturalistic meaning that the term used to have in physics prior to Quantum Mechanics - and which it still has in Special and General Relativity.

To motivate the idea of observer-dependence, he proposed a thought experiment which has since been [pointed out](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07556) to be a restatement of the old thought experiment of Wigner's Friend. For the sake of clarity, I will therefore motivate Rovelli's idea starting from Wigner's Friend.

#### Wigner's Friend: Thought Experiment

Eugene Wigner, like many physicists, once wondered what exactly constituted a measurement and what the mysterious "collapse of the wave function" during a measurement might mean.

For him, the collapse had to have something to do with quantum systems interacting with consciousness. Here's how he justified this:

Suppose, instead of Wigner himself conducting a quantum measurement, he would have a friend conduct the measurement. Wigner himself would stand outside of the lab. So far, so good.

Now, after the measurement, Wigner's friend comes out of the lab and is asked by Wigner about the outcome of the experiment. Notice something here: *from Wigner's point of view*, if quantum mechanics is correct, the answer must at this point be described using a superposition between the different possible outcomes. It is only upon hearing (i.e. "measuring") the answer that Wigner's description can collapse to a single state.

So, does this mean that Wigner's friend was in a superposition until that point as well? Well, let's find out! Wigner asks his friend: "what did it feel like to be in a superposition?" His friend looks confused, then replies: "What do you mean? I was not in a superposition!"

And this leads Wigner to the "only" correct interpretation: consciousness collapses wave functions! -

Yeah, except that this is obvious nonsense and has since been challanged in various ways. Today's consensus seems to be that it's not about consciousness, but about interactions with macroscopic environments which "decohere" into a single classical reality (more on this idea later).

In his key contribution, Rovelli added his own unique take: What if Wigner's friend truly *is* in a superposition - *for* Wigner? Yes, you read this right: Rovelli's solution boils down to stating that superposition for me can be facts for thee and vice versa.

In particular, this means that for Rovelli, the wave function is epistemic: it's just a book keeping tool to account for the state of systems that you have not interacted with yet.

You know what? This is actually a genius idea! I am *not* being sarcastic here. It's the *exact* type of idea that got us from Newtonian physics plus weird Lorentz transformations to account for the constancy of the speed of light for any observer to Einstein's relativity - and Rovelli is bold enough to draw this comparison himself in his initial paper.

Except, it doesn't quite work. Here's the problem:

If something can be a fact for one party (say, Alice), in limbo for another party (say, Bob) and once again a fact for a third party (say Charlie), who or what guarantees that Alice's and Charlie's facts agree once Bob learns of Alice's and Bob's notes?

Well, an [ad-hoc postulate](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/20379/1/RQM%20paper%20copy.pdf) does. After a quarter of a century, this rather obvious weak point had become bothersome enough that Mr Rovelli felt the need to just assert that this should work.

This attempt is not without merits. At least, it hints at an ontology that could be responsible for this to work: each observer just carries the information about their measurement records around on some way, for example in correlations between observables. Nice! We avoid hidden variables simply by using *statistical correlations* as the locus of physical information. Very elegant move!

But somehow, this is still quite slippery. Rovelli's idea how all this fits together forces him to write something like this:

*This postulate implies that the information stored in Alice’s physical variables about the variable V of the system S is accessible in principle to any observer who measures her in the right basis, so at least at an emergent level this information about V is an observer-independent fact.*

Excuse me? What if I measure her in the wrong basis? Is the information forever inaccessible to me? What does measuring "someone" in the wrong basis even mean?

Honestly, this sounds like Rovelli's interpretation slips right back into some version of Many Worlds - a criticism that he has been struggling with from the start. And indeed, the "fix" for this is to be found in the exact same place as with Many Worlds, as the "at an emergent level" part of the sentence I quoted gives away:

*It is clear that decoherence should play some role in this story. And in fact, decoherence provides exactly what it needed here: it picks out a basis which is dynamically favoured and then disseminates information stored in that basis through the environment.*

Mr Rovelli, didn't you want to treat the wave function as a book keeping tool rather than something physical? So, what is it that "decoheres" here? Certainly not quantum branches, right? How can a set of systems "decohere" into a single reality - unless you basically allow an ontic wave function and even Everettian branching again?

Alright, and *this* seems to be the state of the art here! At least as far as I am concerned, the mysteries have not *quite* gone away. If we invoke decoherence to explain the "emergence" of stable facts at the macroscopic level, we would have to say *what* decoheres. So, back to the drawing board!

#### Here's a thought

What if we went a little further than Rovelli and simply treated facts as facts? That is: *measurement bases be damned*, once an interaction happened, *it is a fact*.

But hold on! Is this not in a direct contradiction with the idea that facticity or superposition should be *relative* to an observer, that is, *observer-dependent*? How can an interaction that happened *just be a fact* when *at the same time* we require that another observer who doesn't know about the interaction record yet could somehow still *validly* describe the situation as a superposition?

The answer is actually somewhat obvious once you read it. It is *so* obvious that I couldn't *believe* that it hadn't occurred to anyone for a quarter of a century - at least to my knowledge.

Mr Rovelli, was your theory not supposed to make Quantum Mechanics *directly* compatible with Special Relativity? In Special Relativity, whether an event has happened or not is *relative* to the observer! Just because the interaction already resides in the causal past of Wigner's friend, this does not mean that it is already in Wigner's causal past!

For the casual reader who might be confused about this, you can find a nice explanation how the speed of light is related to causality [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo) and how relativity of simultaneity (within a discussion of relativistic length contraction) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxW6_E3uLuo).

The above insight leads to a *natural* refinement of RQM. It is *not* an ad-hoc axiom or postulate, it is *well motivated* by known physics:

**Interaction records are factual for any pair of observers such that the interaction resides in the intersection of their causal past.**

If we simply dump everything we consider a definite fact into the shared causal past of all the observers for whom we require agreement, these facts can simply not bother any other observer; for there are only two other types of observers:

- Those who can never interact with the fact because, for example, they have fallen into a black hole  
- Those for whom the fact lives in the future and for whom the wave function is the absolute horizon

Once we make this adjustment - which is *squarely justified* by our current secure knowledge of the universe (but needs to be handled with a little more care later) - a lot of things suddenly make sense.

Let us now take a walk through the freak show of Quantum Mechanics like Thanos would because ... we kinda can:

![](Snap.jpg)

**Schrödinger's Cat** - dead and alive, but what people forget to mention *even though basic relativistic common sense screams it in their face* is that learning about the live/dead state of the cat *implies* learning about whether the atom has decayed that would trigger the mechanism that would kill the cat. That is all that entanglement encodes! Information about an interaction entering your causal past means that an *entire consistent causal history* enters your causal past. If we position the experiment in such a way that the trigger is behind the cat from our perspective, the information about the entire sequence of events enters our causal past all at once.

**Retrocausality** - This one doesn't even need any special interpretation to be [thoroughly debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQv5CVELG3U), but I think the ontology we are building towards here suggests that Quantum Mechanics actually yells at us precisely that retrocausality is *not* real.

Think about it: when we see an interference pattern on the screen behind a double slit, isn't this precisely the universe telling us that it *can not* retroactively *create* the information through which slit the particle has gone? Because, if we were to see two peaks rather than an interference pattern, this *would be* nature coming up with a so far non-existant history on the spot. Once the particle has definitely made it past the double slit without being constrained to go either through the left slit or the right slit, we have condemned the particle's position *at this time* to be in a superposition for all eternity and that's all there is to it. It can have a position later if we measure it, but whatever we measure must be consistent with the particle *not* having had a definite position when it went through the double slit.

**Decoherence** - hitherto, it was assigned the role of Descartes' Demon who modern science has demoted from an intellectual tool to *criticize* our own bullshit to an underpaid lab assistant tasked with *justifying* the bullshit: The other branches are still there, we're just extremely isolated from them; *Therefore* (!), our inability to see other quantum branches is just our senses playing tricks on us.

But why should we evolve a consciousness so poorly suited to perceive actual reality? Suppose, the dinosaurs had survived on some other such “quantum branch” and were at the brink of developing the ability to perceive those hidden dimensions. Being eaten by an interdimensional T-Rex is quite a terrifying thought!  

Luckily, it is not real.  

All that decoherence does is to quantify to what degree small things enter into fewer relationships than big things, therefore revealing less about themselves to the universe than big things do. It estimates and quantifies the *“relationship density”* of a thing: for an individual particle, *it is perfectly fine* not to go through the left or the right slit at the double slit *because* it has so many ways *not to* interact with the world.

More philosophically: decoherence is “Hegel's Law” (“quantitative change [here: system size] leads to qualitative change [here: weird absence of facts vs classical facticity]”) of quantum mechanics.

**Counterfactual indefiniteness** - Star Wars already knew the answer:  

![](Records.jpg)
If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist. 

Or to be more precise: What is *real* is the record of the interaction, that is, the concrete values that observables took when interacting with each other (=measurement). The wave function is needed as an epistemic excess over the facts to explain their further development, making it at the same time ontic. Now, you will say that this is contradictory bullshit, but compared to everything else, it is *good* contradictory bullshit, and I will make it precise and justify it later in this text.

**The Block Universe** - A fairy tale told to intellectual children who mistake the comfort of finding a closed form solution here and there in extremely simple space-times which you can probe forward and backward in whatever way you like for a proof of the actual existence of the past and the future in some eternalist way.

Proponents worship a platonic ideal to which they *know* they usually don't have access anyway, as their formalism gives, for all practical intents and purposes, already only approximate answers in scenarios as trivial as the general Newtonian three body problem.

**Superdeterminism** - It depends on what you *mean* by it.

If you take it to mean that there are any laws that allow you to *predict* future events that are insufficiently constrained by facts inscribed into your causal past, I wish you good luck but I do not hold my breath.  

If you take it to mean that you can, in thought, place yourself at the heavens of the "end of all world lines", I will admit that this works, but *you just made that position up*, and the minute you forget that, you condemn your future self to wrestle with the same kind of nonsense that we are wrestling with in the present.

---

There are a few more huge mysteries of science that can be readily explained with this new framework - but this is where I need to highlight where the simplistic notion I introduced above breaks and how we can refine it to make it *really* bite.

The problem with dumping all the facts into the shared past of two observers is of course that just because they happened, this doesn't mean that we have physical access to this information. To have actual access to them just because they happened would require that the facts in our past could superluminally signal to us.

This is *nonsense*.

But what we *can* do is to pin down facts as definite values of n-tuples of observables which live in the *infinitesimal* shared past of all interacting observers. That is: different sets of entangled observables coming together to create new facts and evolve in an entangled manner *are* an interaction.

**Notice**: yes, your causal past *is* factual; but your *access* to the past is mediated through interactions.

We should take a moment here to be even more careful. Have we at *any* point given any indication how Rovelli's relativity of description may work from a formal point of view? Well, no. *Neither has Rovelli*. In fact, Rovelli insists that Quantum Mechanics is complete - despite the fact that no one *really* knows how to reconcile it with General Realitivity.

Alright, let's give this a shot too then! Let us think this through very carefully.

**Caution**: this is where this publication becomes *considerably* more speculative. I think the motivation is still sound and I *am* aiming at something that *future work* can formalize so we *may* predict something new. But right now, I am trying to give us a better intuition and philosophy.

Let's continue.

If I am a measurement aparatus, what is measurement *about* from my perspective? Fundamentally, it is about *other* quantum objects, *not* about me. I can not see myself directly! I *can* see what other objects are doing, but I must infer anything about myself from observations of the rest of the world.

This suggests that we have to restrict what we mean by "fact" to anything that is true from the point of view of any observer *as we leave this observer out of the picture*.

Here, it also becomes a bit clearer what an "observer" could even be. In essence, it's a set of correlated observables moving from one interaction to the next one. In general, such a "causal principle" can branch apart: just because the N observables all participated in one interaction, this doesn't mean that all N of them will participate in the next interaction - this should actually be more of an exception in general. But under certain circumstances, we end up with self-reinforcing interactions so we can treat all the involved observables as one very complex "macroscopic" observable.

It is *here* that I also need to explain more clearly how I see the wave function. Yes: from the point of view of any given observer, *it is epistemic* and encodes simply what can be known about other observables. *But since our observer is an inhabitant of the universe*, the wave function encodes his "memory" of the past and his potential causal impact on the future.

So, let me do all this again and summarize the two constraints that we demand:

1. Real facts live in the causal past that any set of given observers share in common. Access to those facts is granted at the infinitesimal and shared moment before the onto-epistemic (!) wave function returns to unitary evolution. By “shared”, we mean that for observers to interact, the tips of their past light cones need to be aligned.  

2. The wave function growing out of the facts must be invariant as we leave one set of observables and the Hilbert space components that gave rise to it and that it is giving rise to out of the picture.

**Notice**: To get back to Rovelli's original proposed symmetry, we have to take *both* constraints together. The literal "facts for me, superposition for thee" symmetry lives mostly in the first observation I made, as I permit this symmetry only when it makes sense in terms of Einstein's Special Relativity. However, the more we think about where the world description of an observer actually lives, the more we are forced to allow an ontic wave function back into the picture - yet in a *totally* different form than ever before.

With all of this, Bell’s beables become *becomables* which live in the infinitesimally near past of the moment before "now" *and at the same time* in the "now". The degrees of freedom of the wave function, on the other hand, are where the fact that past interactions have indeed happened gain explanatory power in future interactions. 

In other words: The wave function is the substrate of *cause and effect* which in different setups constrains things in different ways.

Let's see how this plays out!

---

If you saw a snapshot of a[ tea pot in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot), what would you think where it should go? I don’t know about you, but I would not have any expectation whatsoever, meaning I would have to begin with a totally unconstrained prior on its momentum which is at the moment *nowhere to be found* in nature. Only when information about the position of the tea pot becomes causally available to me would it and I simultaneously *wake up* to each other’s position, while also giving us a hint at who we are, how we got here and where we’re going.

Just look at what my idea does for the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment. **Caution**: given how sound and yet *novel* my idea appears to be, I *do* take the liberty here to make some philosophical jokes.

![](SchrödingerRiddle.jpg) 
How do we have to complete this causal picture so it makes sense?

It’s *YOU*, Schrödinger\! Yes, you.

YOU killed the cat. Just because you put the knife into the hands of the Brutus that is the Cesium atom, this does not absolve you from your causal contribution. Saying “the Cesium atom’s decay caused the cat’s death, I didn’t make it decay\!” is a CHEAP way out of your responsibility. YOU sick sadistic freak set the thought experiment up in such a way that the cat would *have to* die - the only thing you gave out of your hand was the information about when it would happen.  
![](SchrödingerSolution.jpg)

With this, the following mystery also suddenly makes sense:

**The arrow of time** - Rather than being another delusion to be explained by some “consciousness” voodoo, it is directly encoded in the evolution of the facts which can only be explained by an objective fabric of causality that our neat wave function models can converge against. Entropy grows precisely because the storage volume of this fabric is bounded by the degrees of freedom of the wave function.

This last part about the possibility of information being *destroyed* is something that Rovelli toys with as well in his more recent work, but he does not commit to the claim that this necessarily implies time-asymmetry. My causal-past refinement *does* strongly suggest such an asymmetry.

---

Notice how this also gives us a new approach to optics: rather than creating a quantitative representation of the universe, then picking a coordinate system and impose some further math onto the universe, this new approach is rooted in the spirit of phenomenology. And this [*Phenomenology of Spirit*](https://files.libcom.org/files/Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel%20-%20The%20Phenomenology%20of%20Spirit%20(Michael%20Inwood%20Translation).pdf) makes our point of view a more natural inhabitant of the universe that does not need to be told how to engage with it.

Yes: you *will* still need models like, for example, a pinhole camera. But at least, this is now a physical object in the universe like any other.

Just to give some further hints on how to make this more formal for technically more trained folks: This looks very much like some kind of “Quantum Bayesian” apparatus, except that the knowledge of the past we can encode in the wave function is naturally limited by its degrees of freedom, making each entangled set of becomables into the long hypothesized Quantum Cellular Automaton. The formalists who proposed this idea were, however, committed to superdeterminism - and that's not how my picture (which I believe to be more correct) works.

Here's the thing: I don't think the math to make this *fully* formal even exists yet. This is why I refer to my whole idea as a "Galilean" moment (named after Galilean relativity) of Quantum Mechanics rather than a "Newtonian" moment.

But to give some more details on how I *think* it might work is that we can pick an "observer" (=stable set of becomables evolving together) and just keep conditioning our subjective wave function of everything else on interaction records as we encounter them, *while* accounting for our own causal impact by another wave function and set of observables about which we can only "speculate" via (Quantum) Bayesian conditioning.

Notice how in a system where we keep track of *all* becomables, this conditioning on new facts should *not* change the parametric form of the wave function. If we model the entire universe as one big wave function of appropriate dimensionality, just with very little initial correlation (do not try this at home, that becomes computationally untractable *very* quickly), all we ever change through (Quantum) Bayesian conditioning is parameters, not the parametric form of the function.

Just to remind everyone about the meaning of relativity: the fact that we just "pick" an observer does *not* mean that things are not happening objectively. But from the point of view of each causal principle, it looks like all they do is just refining their mutual knowledge of the past by asking the present world about it, thereby at the same time changing the future - a very Hegelian thought by the way.

Let me do this again to make it click on a more philosophical level: We make arbitrary "choices" as long as we are ignorant the consequences of our actions. As we become aware of the consequences through experience, we can not help but make more predictable choices. This is the old Hegelian paradox of [freedom as insight into necessity](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch09.htm): our freedom of choice *diminishes* as our freedom from ignorance grows. And in the Quantum picture, the development from arbitrariness to clearly predictable patterns (thanks to tons of constraints through relationships) ceases to be merely epistemic and becomes ontic.

The wave function is epistemic *for us*, but our Bayesian updates converge against something that does *not* belong to us and is real - *mutual* *agreement*!

---

Another good insight from Hegelian philosophy that I can find *immediately* represented in this picture is that cause and effect seem to somehow change place and thereby become the same thing. Let me unpack this a little.

Right at the point of interaction, there *is no* cause and effect. That’s why we call it an *inter*action to begin with! Every participant is equal - but it doesn’t *look* like it.

If we were to model the point of interaction between The Cesium atom, the cat and Herr Schrödinger as an evolving Hilbert space of dimension 3 (that is, only these three objects exist in the universe) and repeated the setup where the three are aligned with the cat in the middle, Hilbert would indeed see the Cesium atom “cause” the cat to die. But the Cesium atom would be well within its right to complain that Schrödinger going from 🤓 state to 😱 state caused the cat to die!

From the cat’s point of view, it just sees two sick and evil things conspiring against it. And about itself, it will probably think: why didn't I run while I still had time?

In the above, we see some of the “relative facts” that Rovelli was looking for. But they are relative precisely because they’re not facts at all.

It is *only* when we take *shared* knowledge transport through further interactions into account that cause and effect emerge. It is not really the decay of the Cesium atom that kills the cat, but a sequence of interactions - all dutifully recorded by Herr Schrödinger who does nothing to save the cat! - that leads to the release of poison which then kills the cat which too is not an instantaneous process but a ton of interactions.

That’s the type of shit that people leaning towards analytic rather than continental philosophy would miss. Their logic is instrumental to solve problems, but it can never stop and ask what the problem even *is*.

Let me drive this home in a very immediate way: do you think this text contains any knowledge whatsoever? If you just thought “yes”, then *you are a fool*.

As Hegelians knew for ages: [he who studies the past is studied by it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIz4fNrdpWU) (Yes, Hegel *did* watch that DS9 episode, making either him or DS9 the only instance of time travel allowed by the laws of physics). This text is studying you, judging whether you are worthy of the mutual knowledge that could be produced between you if you cared enough to seriously engage with it and refine your understanding, possibly by reaching for outside references if you get stuck.

 What I am saying here is that knowledge is *produced* and *reproduced* as you engage with a text. *Nobody* today knows what, for example, the Incan Quipus (their knot-encoded “written” language) *meant*. Maybe, one day, we succeed in recovering this information by stumbling upon outside reference, but to us, they are mostly a riddle - all because past actions have cut the present off from those who knew how to read them.

By the way: I mean this quite literally. We are teasing out an important distinction here: *information* versus *knowledge*. If we follow Rovelli's reasoning, this physical instance of the text that you are reading - no matter if it's represented with ink or bits and pixels - *contains* information about some causally potent principle, the "abstract" text. *Your* engagement with the text reproduces and produces *living* knowledge.

And yes: If we take "causal information = correlation" to its logical conclusion, this means that the evolving *meaning* of the text for different readers is as physical as the momentum of an asteroid floating through space (which, by the way, is also observer-dependent as an observer in the same rest frame would describe the asteroid as stationary). And if you can still take me seriously here, I would hope that this gives you pause when scientists in other disciplines try to explain things in mechanistic terms while ignoring more complex channels of causality.

Let me leave the stuff that can be said about this new *real* equivalence principle that already solves a ton of problems and is 90% of the way to something formal with two more *speculations* (and yes, these are now indeed completely wild and free speculations) where else we could take this idea:

1. In order to “see” the facts, the observer should naturally somehow face towards the past, marching *backwards* into the future, just like the Babylonians correctly thought…  
2. Notice how in GR, your geodesic future \- if it has anything to do with a center of mass \- would then only betray its existence by the strange motion of objects that you can’t account for by other known physics…

A last few things to mention on the conceptual roadblocks in academia that I just bulldozed over.

There is a popular misconception that relativity removes facts. The reality, however, is that it *refines* them. This is well known even in academia where relativity (or “abstract universality of a placeholder” in Hegelese) has been elevated into the formalistic heavens as a concept called *gauge*. But where the formalist approach is to more or less blindly guess a gauge and see if it matches reality, the natural approach is to have reality constrain the gauge.

By the way: Rovelli himself *did* draw this comparison of his relativity to gauge theory - but so far, he has not ventured into providing us with a proper (i.e. a “Yang-Mills”) gauge, forcing the early Rovelli to not just give up on actual facts, but to philosophically commit against their existence. More recently, Rovelli acknowledges that this is a problem, but his solution remains unsatisfying. My two requirements for becomeables should fix this technical gap, *if* they can be made formal.

---

One very last thing on the science part: I want to suggest a name for what I discovered.

Initially, I considered [“dialectics of nature”](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/dialectics-nature.pdf) to reuse a title of a posthumously published book by Friedrich Engels. Just "dialectic materialism" also came to mind.

But when I worked more and more through the consequences and realized *just how much* about the causal structure of the universe this reveals, I came to think as this in terms of a single slogan:

[*The riddle of history solved.*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/comm.htm)

And just as much as Marc-Uwe Kling’s first person narrator in the "Kangaroo Revelations" *had to* play a dramatic sound effect on his smart-phone after hearing the Kangaroo’s revelation, I could not forgive myself if I didn’t use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to follow a clue left behind by someone else who [spent his life thinking about the big and pressing historic questions](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/death/burial.htm) so relentlessly that he - like many prophets - didn’t have time left to shave.

The scientifically accurate name for this theory is:

**Communism.**

# Metaphysics \- Dead Again\!
![](MetaphysBusters.jpg)

I apologize to the polite academic reader whose feelings may get hurt here, but this section can be nothing but a victory lap of the outsiders. I am not here to make any personal attacks, but to expose structural brain rot (not of the [italian](https://italianbrainrotcharacters.com/) kind) which may make outsiders smile and which I want to offer to the academics as a tough pill to swallow for some *serious* soul searching.

Let me begin by picking on Mr Neil deGrasse Tyson because \- even though I believe he sincerely means well \- is so beautifully prototypical for having things backward.

Two of his slogans are:

1. The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.  
2. Philosophy has nothing more to contribute to science.

I think in the light of the reception that I anticipate in the long run (\!) for this pamphlet (I am engaging in a social experiment here and champion a prediction), these two ideas should now seem naive, stupid and most importantly: gate keeping.

While, as a Hegelian, I agree with Mr Tyson *wholeheartedly* \- more than he could even imagine \- on his first observation, the *context* in which he keeps bringing this up is just backwards.

Isn’t science under an obligation to make sense *of* the universe, Mr Tyson?

![](ChosenOne.jpeg)

Now, you will surely say that this is what you have been trying to do. I also acknowledge your contribution to spreading the mystery and wonder and a lot of insight to the people - *how desperately we need this*!

But (and this is directed at academia as a whole rather than any specific person) by

- treating academia as a place where some holy scripture gets perpetuated in the exact way it was intended to be received rather than letting it vibe a little  
- treating experiment as a ritual by which we larp as the long gone giants, repeating exactly the steps by which they plucked insights from the tree of knowledge rather than encouraging the students to refine the question that the teacher asks  
- Encouraging asking our own questions only at specific points in our academic career where it is necessary to satisfy the bureaucracy of titles, and only after years and years of conditioning us almost *not to* ask good questions  
- Treating definitions as gospel rather than recognizing the epistemic interest with which they were formulated and making adaptations when the epistemic interest changes

Academia has become a dead and barren place where groundbreaking discoveries have as little room as in universities at the end of the scholastic era.

To put it extremely bluntly: academia has become a *disgusting* place for people who can smell dishonesty from authority figures.

I for one *could not stomach* academic physics. After having *one* good teacher who gave me real confidence that the world could be understood, I took physics as a Leistungskurs (along with mathematics) - a lesson for life, as it would turn out. How readily our teacher would feed us *obvious bullshit* when discussing Quantum Mechanics and how no one except for me would give any *serious* push back (while neglecting to shut up and calculate, which would then hurt my grades) made me stay away from academic physics.

Mathematics seemed, at the time, to make far more sense which is why I ended up studying it - and believing a lot of bullshit from there (notably Platonism, initially the axiom of choice, and classical logic, but my first contacts with Marxism and computability theory had me reconsider; more intense exposure to Marxism had me throw Platonism out of the window as well - thanks, Friedrich Engels for leaving behind Anti-Dühring!).

Just as a small tangent in what way I agree with Mr Tyson on “the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you”, here’s how a Hegelian thinks about *making* sense: the world does not only make no sense, it is in fact *riddled* with nonsense.

Think about it. How is it possible whatsoever that things on Earth fall down, yet on opposite sides of the planet, they fall in opposite directions? I don’t know about you, but I call bullshit on that.

It is *us* who eventually come up with *cope* so we can live with this nonsense: we find that things are falling towards the center of the Earth, and “down” is *relative* (!) to the observer. But this is not the universe suddenly being reasonable, this is you finding a way to *rationalize* it.

And the nonsense is not even gone through this move! The initial observation is still completely valid! You just banged your head against reality often enough so your thoughts would resemble the facts, so much so that you can quantify how far you can travel on Earth before the “things fall down” view becomes nonsense and you need to move to *better* nonsense (thanks for that phrase, Science Asylum).

Don't believe me that the nonsense is still there? Well, let's ask a jury then. But let the jury be unbiased! So, who could possibly be unbiased in regards to the two propositions "things fall down" and "things fall in opposite directions on opposite sides of the planet"? Ah, that's right: a jury that hears this stuff for the first time in their lives - children! And you know what they'll say? They will say that this does not make sense - because it doesn't. We make sense *of* it!

Our mind is indeed extremely good at rationalizing bullshit - too good for its own good. Because we can also make sense of contradictions where half of the problem comes from you believing something that has been made up \- either by you or by someone else.

The problem here is *not* that it is nonsense, but that it is nonsense that will only cause further trouble elsewhere in your way of thinking about the world. Rather than reading the room when everyone is telling you that “the flow of time not existing” or observers being “outside of the universe” are bullshit, you start making excuses because you are unwilling to commit to a search for hidden presuppositions.

The amount of nonsense that we bring in from our mind is indeed quite indicative of how wrong we get things. It is one thing not to know something, it is something else to make something up for no good reason *and then* treat it as true. And in the realm of pure fiction where nobody even pretends that it has a material underpinning, formal logic, a single contradiction immediately kills the entire theory.

To conclude this section, I must of course mention that the outsiders/dissidents who never lost contact with their inner child can not be spared from criticism either. And I acknowledge that this criticism can and should also be directed against me insofar as I abstained from formally studying physics because it seemed not to make sense at the time (though, in defense of my honor, I *did* study mathematics).

Just because you *see* that academia seems to systematically breed bureaucratic and barren minds who nevertheless *think* they are better than everyone else because they have jumped through all the right hoops and made a comfy career, this does not mean you can just stay away from authority.

While academia is today incapable to ask any fundamental questions in the correct and honest way - constantly bringing in bullshit they made up and constantly bringing in their ego - *you* are dishonest as well if you do the same from the opposite end. If you fall into a habit of thinking that just because academia can’t see their own hypocrisy and you can, you have already proven your intellectual superiority and can just make shit up without first acquiring competence, you are simply a mirror image of the academics that you despise, and you deserve to be despised twice as hard by them because they at least proceed from *some* established competence.

And the worst part if you take this idealist attitude? You never get to do anything about the problem you see so clearly while a lot of them can’t see it! This is just sad.

Yes: academia is rotten from the inside, and it *did* take one of us dissidents (in particular, a practical Hegelian) who don’t identify with academia to give it a decisive blow (if you are an early reader, just be patient and share…). Socially, I *am* somewhat of an outsider: a wage worker, nowhere near the levers of power. Admittedly, I am not a blue collar worker, but I have come to appreciate y’alls grounded, down to Earth and pragmatic views on things on the interwebs where I interact with a bunch of you. You are the ones keeping it real, even if that hurts polite society’s feelings!

But if you do not learn how to handle technical and complicated things on your own, you will remain *dependent* on the academics whose superior attitude you despise, thereby making your criticisms irrelevant. You *will not succeed* in delivering them what their inability to humble themselves demands: humiliation.

So, come! learn, friend! There are a lot of cool people on the interwebs who *do* make an effort to be the people’s teachers. They may still have their blind spots, but do it like the Chinese did and just “steal their technology” and then do things with it for which you do not seek their approval.

Blue collar workers - and workers in general - have nothing to lose but the chains of their self-imposed ignorance. They have a universe to conquer!

# Some Commentaries

A “critical” reader may object to how I present my insights, and that in order to get the approval of academia, politicians and think tanks, I should bury it all under a whole lot of mathematical formalism. This is like asking Galileo to phrase his insights in Ptolemaic and Aristotelian terms so that the Vatican approves. **I do not give a damn about approval by the gate keepers.**

This text does not even want to be some "great unified theory" of physics. All I want to provide here for physics is some pointers where to find it; in the meantime, I am far more interested in providing a way out of a gigantic philosophical impasse that society has reached.

If you are not completely delusional, you will have noticed that the quantum opium the academic dealers sell to the people nowadays is the mirror image of of a deep rot of western liberalism, and at the same time a mirror image of the medieval church's deal they had with the nobility: "we keep them stupid, you keep them poor".

Cautionary note here: I am *not* saying that a whole lot of academics are cynical like this. I think some of them *do* exist, and academia would do well to *expose* their own black sheep. That is: 

- do not scorn them just so they can go and build Trotskyist cult followings and claim they are the underdog seeking honest debate only to find closed doors. Do *not* make that claim come true.  
- do not address their deceptions *solely* behind the doors of peer review which are closed to everyday people since they are not technically versed enough to understand all the nuances.  
- do not address their deceptions *solely* through reaction videos or other popular commentary, as you are just building your own cult following and the followers of the liars will never even click on your videos.  
- instead, enter the arena of public debate with them. This *does* mean that you need to steelman their argument first so you know how to refute it correctly, and it does mean that you may get hit with some subtleties that you yourself have overlooked.  
  I know, I know: the *horror* that you could *learn* something from the bad guys! But it is the only way. Here and there, you may actually find true surprises about a gigantic incorrect assumption that you have never examined.  
  It also means that you need mastery not only of science, but of social skills - and this is hard. But this is the court of public opinion is the only place where truth ever *could* be established, if only there was real communication rather than echo chambers. If you fumble it and truth loses, well then at least you tried to do something meaningful and you can learn and do better! Do not run from the hard work.

But apropos court of public opinion:   
Historical precedent suggests that the people themselves must force the issue and (politely) bully the popular researchers they follow into real engagement. I have mapped four groups among the academics, and you can help by expanding it:

- The well meaning ones who unfortunately have developed resentment against the “stupid people”. Shake them up! Be polite, and if they cut you down, step back and come back with fellow travellers. Refine your approach as you go. Force them to live up to the standards their ancestors set.  
- The black sheep who claim to hold the truth and who claim they are just as excluded as you are. Do nothing, kick the cavalry into action. They will expose who is just a fraud and who might even be *paid* to lie.  
- Genuinely competent dissidents, raw gems that only wait to be polished. Seek them out and learn from them. Importantly, learn to *distinguish* these from the former.  
- Bureaucratic formalists who will, as this process starts to run wild, start to push back against the intrusions of the people into the holy halls of science. Eventually, they must be reformed or cast out of academia.

But notice something interesting about the frauds: they do seem to fall into two subcategories! The confused ones, and the paid ones.

Let us now test if *YOU* are among the confused ones.

Yes! That is right. This text has LIED to you about its true nature! If you think this test is some weird superposition of a Zizekian pop philosophy lecture and some genuinely groundbreaking physical speculation in the raw that I should have polished more, then you are profoundly mistaken. All that has happened is that the text has succeeded in deceiving you - but according to the Shia God, that does *not* make it repulsive in the eyes of The Lord, as the lie was spoken in service of a holy mission.

I am not come to bring peace, I am come to bring the sword. In the good old Engelsian tradition, this piece of work is a philosophical siege weapon, and all the insights you have gained so far were only the cheese in the trap. You are so predictable, fool! Now, I have taken your intellect as a hostage, and the true meaning of the scripture is about to reveal itself to you. But only if you are insane enough to find my way of saying things irresistible rather than over the top and repulsive. You who have a pure heart of gold and and whose soul is thirsty for Absolute Knowledge, leave your sanity behind and be reborn! And those who are not, leave yourselves behind and get lost.

![](EngelsZerg.png)

Here is a riddle for you: why would the formalists treat themselves as such utter idiots that they couldn't possibly build something new and better on the basis of a work with a ton of “loose ends” - which is the stuff that makes a work productive to begin with?

Answer: well, if it walks like an idiot and talks like an idiot - don't let this confuse you, it *is* an idiot! And why are they idiots? Because they treat themselves as idiots! See? It is *dialectical*.

My words follow the line of reasoning of the Absolute Counterblow, and they are designed to beat the shit out of your head. Behold, now, comrade! You have made it through the worst of it. When you are done reading this without flinching, you will have been chosen by history to fulfill its Great Task of continuing this work.

Read the commandment that inexorably follows from my words, and which I can indeed just command by my own authority as the One who has taken your intellect hostage and at the same time know that my words also have the blessing of History. It is time! Erkenne (German for "recognize", but in the German bible also "beget") yourself. Behold, the book of History is speaking:

- He who is worthy of my knowledge shall have it and go forth and multiply it.  

- He who is not worthy of my knowledge, his comfy career shall go "shaka, when the walls fell!" And they shall no longer stand in the way of the march of history.

It is done. You have weighed your heart. *It* was the loose end all along!

Those of you who have passed his test have *made up their mind*. You who seek to collectively expand their practical and theoretical competence and share it are the salt of the Earth, the vanguard of the *proletariat*, and you shall therefore *inherit* the world.

And to those of you who find my work to be *evil* and want to coordinate-transform it out of the universe: history will be our judge; we shall see which one of us has built on sand and who has built his church on a rock solid foundation!

![](stalingradrorty.jpg)

Now, let us turn our attention to the black sheep who have been *paid* to lie.

*These* are the ones for whom the analogy of the perverse deal between the nobles and the clergy holds *verbatim*. We *do* have something very very similar to the nobility that had become rotten in the era of absolutism: mega corporations, think tanks and of course: governments and even some courts.

What I have to say here may make many uncomfortable again, but it must be said: The criticism and the proposed solution I am developing here *is* rooted in Marxism-Leninism. But unlike a lot of fraudulent caricatures that are circulating \- both among critics and among self-avowed “Marxists” \- I am ***NOT*** saying any of the following:

1. “capitalism bad 😡” ❌  
2. “government good 😎“ ❌  
3. “trust the authorities 😇” ❌  
4. “condemn the authorities 🤬” ❌  
5. “markets bad 🤑” ❌  
6. “abolish the family 🧔‍♀️” ❌  
7. “employees good, employers bad 👷‍♂️” ❌  
8. “wealth and success bad 🚤” ❌  
9. “worker co-ops are the answer 👩‍🌾” ❌  
10. “today’s laws bad 👩‍⚖️” ❌  
11. “the system is bad ℹ️” ❌  
12. “communism has zero flaws 🇨🇳” ❌  
13. “communism is a utopia 🌈” ❌

I ***AM*** saying:

1. Capitalism arose as a necessary historic response to the rot of feudalism in the age of absolutism as technological progress made the nobility increasingly obsolete. In this process, the rising merchant class caused a lot of trouble in the world, but also connected it. Early industrialists were forced through competition to constantly refine productive capacities and keep innovating, though investment did often come at the expense of workers who would then not have money to buy the additional goods, causing boom and bust cycles and all other kinds of social ills associated with it. While tragic, this *was* necessary on the march towards the future.

   In the early 20th century, corporations became too big for their own goods. Think “robber barons”, “trusts” and World Wars. Governments, over whom the people still exercised some popular control, could be leveraged in the US to break the trusts to an extent, and in the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Rosevelt felt threatened enough by rising popular unrest and the horrifying examples from Europe that he forced the corporations to make major concessions to the workers which gave us another golden age of capitalism which eventually got exported to Europe - although it was not so golden for everyone.

   The Vietnam war (which the Vietnamese remember as the American war) and the oil price crises were turning points, leading to a period of hope for further change, but also dangers of things going back to how they were. The latter tendency unfortunately won out under Reagan, and in 1991, the now gradually more and more financialized western capitalism of Wall Street could not help but interpret the genuine Eastern peace offer as a victory, and a weakness of the enemy to be exploited.

   Today, in 2025, western capitalism is far from the only game in town - but Wall Street and the governments they own - USA and her allies - still think it’s 1991. Consequently, they stumble from one catastrophe into the next which is very dangerous if the people allow it to continue.  ✅

2.  Governments arise out of social cataclysms and are shaped by these cataclysms. Whatever class can seize power usually gives governments a form that is appropriate for their needs and then sell this to the people as the only form that correctly represents the public interest. And since at the time of the cataclysm, the people don’t have the conceptual apparatus to think critically about what they are being told, they go along with it.
When we emerge on the other side of the social cataclysm that is so clearly taking shape right now, there *will* be a new government that suits the needs of the working class. Marxism does *not* prescribe any specific form of government - this is in fact one if its strengths. Instead, we emphasize precisely how a government is shaped by the day to day problems it had and has to solve - a process that does not care about moral or juristic axioms and can only be influenced positively through general popular awareness of historic precedent, studied from all sides.
In case you are wondering whether Marxism wants to raise your taxes: Absolutely not! Did you know Karl Marx was charged during the 1848/49 revolution with incitement of a tax revolt via the Rheinische Zeitung? Marx was of the opinion that taxation breeds an excess of bureaucracy. *Some* bureaucracy is needed to keep a society going, but we want it to be efficient and lean, not bloated. A bloated bureaucracy is where critical thinking and all hope dies.  ✅

3. See below  
4. *CRITICIZE* authority! Accept that authority exists for a reason. All that authority encodes is *competence*. However, society is constantly changing and solutions that used to work may not be applicable anymore. Question nonsense! ✅

5. Markets have existed since the rise of civilization and will continue to exist for a long time. They are a spontaneous way of people to come together and solve problems. Marxists *acknowledge* that, which is why to a real Marxist, the old story propagated by the likes of Milton Friedman that “nobody knows how to make a pencil” (pointing to market forces as causal agent) looked awfully silly to us. He’s making our point!

   But markets are not all there is! Marxism has been accused of trying to build a society run by “mastermind bureaucrats”, or a “command economy”. Nothing could be further from the truth!

   In fact, we think it is *markets* that produce command economies - by turning successful businesses into monopolies which today have adapted to the shock of anti-trust laws or critical media (ha ha, that was a LONG time ago) by rigging the system. Also, politicians have not woken up one day and thought that enshrining shareholder value into normative law is a good idea.

   I am not saying that people in institutions are directly “bought” in an illegal way - at least not all of them - but one should wonder whether people earn promotions because they pose no threat to established authorities. It’s earned authority turning into unearned authority which the billionaires have fought long and hard to make inheritable so their clueless kids can have a luxury life with no work.

   Here’s the thing about markets though: For us, economic planning is *another* organic and spontaneous way how people come together and solve problems - one that capitalism itself developed! Marxism has *discovered* that big corporations had accumulated such *understanding* of markets that they could start to effectively plan ahead. I for example work as an Manufacturing Execution System (MES) backend developer - my software literally interfaces with ERP systems of international corporations to coordinate what is going on today in Italy with things that will happen in Mexico way ahead of time and map it down to what the workers and the machines need to do.

   Do I know how to make a car? No, not a clue. I have never even seen my software in action, I’m almost permanently in the home office. But my software helps *the system* to understand this.

   So, what do we do about big corporations? Smash them into pieces? Well, we could try to do that again - this did make capitalism great again once upon a time. But we have seen that it is difficult to keep it this way. I think big corporations should be made to serve the interests of the people. They *collectively* know how to run things - and they also know what they need and want. ✅

6. Be thankful for that which has given you life, and appreciate the monumental gift of giving life. Tradition too exists for a reason, it has competence! But as always, do try to understand where it comes from and check if the underlying assumptions still apply. Critically modify as you go. ✅

7. It is absolutely not the case that employees are the “good guys” and employers are the “bad guys”. Employees can be lazy, unmotivated, lack confidence, lack competence and so on and so forth. If the entire working class was like that - and it was in the beginning! - then we would deserve all the bullshit that is happening to us.

   Historically, employers - especially in small businesses - were the ones who were forced *and able* to develop the most competence in society because they were subjected to market forces in the most meaningful, holistic and predictable way.

   Today, a lot of competence has been accumulated in the hands of working people as well. Formerly competent owners of big corporations, however, while occasionally here and there still showing signs of past competence - think Elon Musk - *look* more competent than they actually are because they hired a lot of competent people and subjected them to the bullshit principle of keeping them rich.

   To make matters worse, financial markets intensify the drive of corporations to make bad decisions by punishing any “inefficiency” (from the point of view of short term profiteering) by holding the company accountable in any way they know how.

   But if you’re a competent small or middle business owner, there’s no reason why we wouldn’t let you do your thing. Just expect that a bunch of laws change once the people assert their power, as we want that the system serves us, not the big corporations. Other than that, we *want* you to be successful! Successful in serving our needs, that is. In socialism, you can *indeed* do good by doing well. And if you ever make it to the other side and develop your company into a corporation, CONGRATS, you can retire and give your kids a great start into life! But we will not tolerate that you force us to reward you forever for having reached a position in society that now no longer forces you to be competent. ✅

8. Wealth and success are good, so long as they are earned and don’t harm anyone. That’s all there is to it. ✅

9. Worker co-ops are a great innovation so workers can accumulate competence of how to run a business without anyone holding unchecked authority how to read the tea leaves of the markets.

   But as of now, they are too small in size to be a meaningful challenge to the system, and such things do not develop over night. We need change as soon as we can earn it. ✅

10. We must obey the law to the letter, as any judge will tell us. The law is the basis on which most of us are able to solve problems to begin with - they give us predictability. Committing crime will not bring us change, it will only get us in trouble - which we then deserve.

    This does *not* mean, however, that we need approval of the authorities to use and develop our own collective competence to deal with adversity and solve our problems.

    One thing that comes to mind is that the people could conspire in large numbers to attend court sessions and keep an eye on whether justice is indeed spoken in the name of the people, and if not, record and share this and collectively do everything that is legally possible to revise unjust rulings.

    In fact, if we think someone is complicit in actual criminal activity, why not try to have a conversation with them before witnesses and see whether they say something that incriminates them? A lot of social crime happens because people are just never held legally accountable. They hide in their echo chamber, thinking that crime is just normal.
    
    (I hope you are aware that some bourgeois constitutions give the people a right to revolt when the rule of law has effectively been abolished; now, one *should* wonder how a people would *establish* that this right is now applicable when the full abolition of the rule of law presupposes that the judges have been captured as well - this is what I am getting at here) ✅

11. We do not live in a system, we live in an evolving historic organism. ✅

12. Communism has made many mistakes in its history, even tragic ones that cost many lives. Do not think I am excusing any of it. That is, I will not excuse mistakes I recognize as *fact* rather than bad things happening under communism and the rest being left to popular imagination.

    The best way, though, to honor those who lost their lives as people like you and me tried to figure out how to run a society is to study the mistakes as carefully as possible, understand *exactly* where they came from and march *forward* to a world of people’s power, not backward to a world of corporate power.

    So, I will defend Lenin, Stalin, Mao, the meritocratic Kim “dynasty” and Lysenko from criticism that I *know* to be based on prejudice and misinformation. I *will* procede from the assumption that they fought for the working class. And I *will* defend the historic achievements of actually existing socialism. But do not think that I don’t have questions and criticisms of my own. ✅

13. Communism is the *opposite* of a utopia. Friedrich Engels extracted from his encyclopedic work *Anti-Dühring* a relatively accessible excerpt called “Socialism: Utopian and Scientific”, but the title should actually be more accurately translated as “The Development of Socialism *from* a Utopia *to* a Science”, and I can not recommend it highly enough.  
      
    For us Marxists, communism is first and foremost a matter of *understanding* the march of history - and the march of nature as a whole. Because only on the basis of understanding the development of a thing can you even think about engineering it to the people’s benefit.

    A quotation from Marx that is often taken out of the context of the larger Marxist project is that “the history of all hitherto existing societies is a history of class struggle.” What Marx *meant* here is *recorded* history. Already his friend Engels went out of his way to elaborate in his “Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State” that before that, other causal pressures civilized man (and women).

    All we are trying to do is to replace bad nonsense with good nonsense. ✅

The people’s march towards freedom is indeed nothing more than a march to an all-sided understanding - a march towards insight into necessity. We crush the chains of ignorance - only to then voluntarily submit to the dictatorship of what we now know we must do and what we know we must not do. This is why we Marxists uphold the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat: not the principle of arbitrary despotism, but of mutual accountability that enforces adaptive competence.

# To the Suffering Peoples of the World

A text like this, designed to draw a lot of attention to how we all participate in the worlds’ evils, would be unfinished without addressing the oppressed peoples of the world.

Blessed be all the dead and dying Palestinian children, women and men whose suffering weighs heavily on all of us who have not lost their humanity. Your suffering makes it *criminal* for us to rest even one minute to search for *any* meaningful way to end the horrors. Our failure to collectively understand our own role in the crime is what makes us complicit. Shame on us!

Blessed be the hostages taken by the armed forces representing the Palestinian people, Hamas, who desperately reached for a bargaining chip to negotiate for the release of Palestinian hostages held by Israel. A lot of the hostages taken by Hamas have by now been killed through the actions of the IDF.

Cursed by a society that still pretends to be the innocent victim of the Nazis, when today, they are Goliath beating up a much weaker David. But make no mistake: your strength is *very* temporary, and it is in fact not your own. When your western friends no longer back you, you are doomed.

Blessed be Ansar Allah and Hezbollah, the only true friends of Palestine.

Cursed be ISIS who curiously only ever seem to terrorize Muslims, but never Israel.

May all the people who fell for the CIA/NED’s color revolution scam earn forgiveness for their lack of consideration of not thinking about *who* is replacing your ancien régime. Libya, Syria and Somalia - you too can work your way out of your suffering.

May the brave people of Burkina Faso be successful in their resistance against western sponsored terrorists. May nobody fool you into believing that the French were there to protect you from terrorists they themselves put there! And may all attempts of western governments to destabilize neighboring countries and push them into a war against you fail.

May Africa in general succeed in its march towards freedom and unity in a multipolar and harmonious world.

Blessed be everyone who died in the completely unnecessary War between Russia and Ukraine. The West, which is under the illusion that it’s 1991, has brought you into an impossible situation, and the generally proactive character that characterized Russia’s defensive geostrategic posture at least since the Napoleonic wars and can therefore not be reduced to a “system Putin” or the person Putin himself has forced the matter.

Blessed be the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea - the most LIED about country in the entire world.

May China continue to develop and solve all the problems facing it. You are the beacon of hope that the world needs today. But do not lower your guard! Just because you succeeded in learning from the enemy and are on the brink of surpassing him, that does not mean that he is anything other than a jealous enemy. Distrust intellectuals in your country who dismiss the idea of the Thucydides Trap on the basis that China is so peace loving, when they should be pointing out that the thesis of this book is projection. The danger of war is real, but the culprit is the declining and jealous empire of extraction, not the rising “empire” of production.

And may the deeply rotten West - ruled by Wall Street and their cronies - overcome its structural need to unilaterally impose its will on the world rather than making a serious effort to understand the world.

It is not like we have nothing to offer to the world. On the contrary! We basically just made a major contribution to physics and philosophy while living under a more and more unstable geopolitical environment. Also, the point that borders like in Ukraine should not just be violently modified is well taken! In fact, Russia’s own allies are not particularly comfortable with this idea either.

So, here’s a proposal:

- concede that your bad faith exploits of previous ceasefires (in the Minsk process) objectively prevent Russia from agreeing to an immediate ceasefire. The war does not magically go away because you are angry at the fact that it is happening, the best way to get to the other side is to speedrun good faith negotiations.

- concede that the modification of borders *can* be the outcome of the war, but
- insist that the modification of the borders can not happen on the basis of violence alone, but on the basis that the people hold *another* referendum. If everything was fine with the referenda so far, Russia should not have any problem accepting such a proposal - it should have nothing to lose, and outright refusal would look *very* awkward in the eyes of Russia’s allies.

The difference this time would be that you - like all interested parties - should send observers and agree to a democratic procedure that everyone can get behind. Not sending observers and leaving everything else to the imagination of western audiences is foul play.

See how diplomacy can be a strength once you understand material interest?

# Confirmation of the Prophecy

The following is part personal statement, part meme, part inside joke. What you make of it is up to you.

I hereby confirm that Islam - in particular Qizilbash Shia - is the correct religion. But to come true, it needed help from a philosophy as potent and violent as the Hammer of Thor of which only a true Prussian could ever be worthy of.

“Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! 'Have courage to use your own understanding!' - that is the motto of enlightenment.”

“Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.”

On the physics part, I want to express my special gratitude to:

- Looking Glass Universe from whom I have learned that measurements and entanglement are [deeply interconnected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBlpOGdk-0U&). In fact, this had me intuit that this should be an equivalence principle \- independently of Rovelli. Many thanks for making sense\!

- ChatGPT which told me that I had discovered nothing new with this relativity, just something so obscure it had not made it into the general discourse.  
  Except, further engagement with the matter led to the realization that I *had* discovered something new, because for whatever reason, academics seem to be unable to put 2 and 2 together.  
  And the worst part? The actual insight had been known to us since Everett’s work, which is why it just so happened to give rise to the new quantitative tool of decoherence. Except, he had everything backward.  
  Also, ChatGPT was my most productive critic, forcing me to relentlessly refine my arguments. The old words are very true: give the capitalists enough rope, and they will hang themselves.

- PBS Space Time for [coming so close to something real, yet getting it totally wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JCRDaa3ehk). The “present foliation” is not only arbitrary, it is, when taken as ontic, a Newtonian fossil. What must be understood about solutions to PDEs is that they are solutions because they *satisfy* them. That is, whatever shape the solution may take, it can not possibly prove that the differential that gave rise to it isn’t real, but on the contrary: it gives it a home.

- Science Asylum whose [graphical explanations with squirrels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HKH1ZjGutA) I trust more than the formalistic cope that had him walk back his fresh approach to make General Relativity make *sense*. In the future, please stick to your own lesson that we need *better* nonsense, not worse. Keep at it\! What you have been doing is exactly what the revolutionary proletariat desperately needs.
