# The Galilean Moment of Quantum Mechanics

Carlo Rovelli's contribution to Quantum Mechanics was to pose the problem correctly, yet he fell just short of drawing the correct conclusions from it. It is as if he had run a marathon, stopped 5m before the finish line and decided to make a picnic.  
According to Rovelli, the appropriate quantum description of the World is *relative* to the observer. What is in a superposition for one observer is a fact for another.  
Genius\! Except, how can two observers for whom an event is a fact agree on the matter of the fact? In Rovelli's world, the probabilities of the wave function have to conspire in such a way that upon information exchange, consistency is guaranteed. If we were to grant any ontic facticity to an event, it would break relativity of the description, so goes the reasoning.

**This is false.**

What Rovelli has generalized here is not the Einsteinian picture of relativity, but the Lorentzian picture of reality conspiring against the experiment so we can never pin reality down.

The first conceptual clue where to find a solution for this is that for any two observers for whom an event is a fact, the fact is safely inscribed into the intersection of their past light cones (which *by Rovelli’s own assumption* is non-empty) where it simply cannot bother anyone else. There are only two other kinds of observers for whom the fact is not in their shared past:

\- Those who can never interact with the fact because, for example, they have fallen into a black hole  
\- Those for whom the fact lives in the future and for whom the wave function is the absolute horizon

Once we make this move which is *squarely justified* by our current secure knowledge of the universe (but needs to be handled with a little more precision later), a lot of things suddenly make sense.

Schrödinger's cat \- dead and alive, but what the *gentlemen scientists* in the ivory tower forget to mention *even though their own formalism **and** basic common sense screams it in their face* is that learning about the live/dead state of the cat *implies* learning about whether the atom has decayed that would trigger the mechanism that would kill the cat. That is all that entanglement encodes. If we position the experiment in such a way that the trigger is behind the cat from our perspective, the information about the entire sequence of events enters our causal past all at once.

Counterfactual indefiniteness: Star Wars already knew the answer:  
![](Records.jpg)
If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist.  
Or to be more precise: The wave function is needed as an epistemic excess over the facts to explain their further development, making it at the same time ontic. Now, you will say that this is contradictory bullshit, but compared to everything else, it is *good* contradictory bullshit, and I will make it precise later in this text.

Decoherence \- hitherto, it was assigned the role of Descartes' demon who those *gentleman* have demoted from an intellectual tool to *criticize* our own bullshit to an underpaid lab assistant tasked with *justifying* the bullshit: Our inability to see other quantum branches is just our senses playing tricks on us.   
But why should we evolve a consciousness so poorly suited to perceive actual reality? Suppose, the dinosaurs had survived on some other such “quantum branch” and were at the brink of developing the ability to perceive those hidden dimensions. Being eaten by an interdimensional T-Rex is quite a terrifying thought\!  
Luckily, it is not real.  
All that decoherence does is to quantify to what degree small things enter into fewer relationships than big things, therefore revealing less about themselves to the universe than big things do. It estimates and quantifies the *relationship density* of a thing. It is "Hegel's Law” (“quantitative change leads to qualitative change”) of Quantum mechanics.

The block universe \- A fairy tale told to intellectual children who mistake the comfort of finding a closed form solution here and there in extremely simple space-times which you can probe forward and backward in whatever way you like for a proof of the actual existence of the past and the future in some eternalist way. Proponents worship a platonic ideal to which they *know* they don't have access anyway, as their formalism gives for all practical intents and purposes already only approximate answers in scenarios as trivial as the general Newtonian three body problem.

Superdeterminism \- It depends on what you *mean* by it.  
If you take it to mean that there are any laws that allow you to *predict* future events that are insufficiently constrained by facts inscribed into your causal past, I wish you good luck but I do not hold my breath.  
If you take it to mean that you can, in thought, place yourself at the heavens of the "end of all world lines", I will admit that this works, but *you just made that position up*, and the minute you forget that, you condemn your future self to wrestle with the same kind of nonsense that we are wrestling with in the present.

There are a few more huge mysteries of science that can be readily explained with this new framework \- but this is where I need to highlight where the simplistic notion I introduced above breaks and how we can refine it to make it *really* bite.

The problem with dumping all the facts into the shared past of two observers is that of course, the facts in our past would have to superluminally signal to us so we have full access to them at any given time. This is *nonsense*. But what we *can* do is to pin down facts as definite values of n-tuples of observables which live in the *infinitesimal* shared past of all interacting observers.

We should take a moment here to be even more careful, because as you may notice, the relativity that Rovelli only rambles about (don’t take it personally, man) does not have *any* representation in our actual formal set of requirements so far (nor in his; Rovelli tried \- but was stuck in the autistic habit of academia to somehow transform the observer out of the universe so the world could not hold him accountable for his causal contribution to the development of the world).

The natural way to express Rovelli’s symmetry is by requiring invariance of the facts and the structure of the wave function *as you leave one set of causes out*. It is a “leave one observer’s contribution out of the picture” type of stability of the facts and their development.

So, let me do this again and summarize the two constraints that we demand:

1. Real facts live in the infinitesimal and shared moment before the wave function returns to unitary evolution. By “shared”, we mean that for wave functions to interact, the tips of their past light cones need to be aligned.  
2. The wave function growing out of the facts must be invariant as we leave one set of observables and the Hilbert space components that gave rise to it and that it is giving rise to out of the picture.

With this, Bell’s beables become *becomables* which live in the infinitesimally near past of the moment before now *and at the same time* in the now. The degrees of freedom of the wave function, on the other hand, are where the fact that past interactions have indeed happened gain explanatory power in future interactions. 

In other words: The wave function is the substrate of *cause and effect* which in different setups constrains things in different ways.

If you saw a snapshot of a tea pot in space, what would you think where it should go? I don’t know about you, but I would not have any expectation whatsoever, meaning I would have to begin with a totally unconstrained prior on its momentum which is at the moment *nowhere to be found* in nature. Only when information about the position of the tea pot becomes causally available to me would it and I simultaneously *wake up* to each other’s position, while also giving us a hint at who we are, how we got here and where we’re going.

Just look at what this does for the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment:

![](SchrödingerRiddle.jpg) 
How do we have to complete this causal picture so it makes sense?

It’s *YOU*, Schrödinger\! Yes, you.

YOU killed the cat. Just because you put the knife into the hands of the Brutus that is the Cesium atom, this does not absolve you from your causal contribution. Saying “the Cesium atom’s decay caused the cat’s death, I didn’t make it decay\!” is a CHEAP way out of your responsibility. YOU sick sadistic freak set the thought experiment up in such a way that the cat would *have to* die, the only thing you gave out of your hand was the information about when it would happen.  
![](SchrödingerSolution.jpg)

With this, we have established:

The arrow of time: Rather than being another delusion to be explained by some “consciousness” voodoo, it is directly encoded in the evolution of the facts which can only be explained by an objective fabric of causality that our neat wave function models can converge against. Entropy grows precisely because the storage volume of this fabric is bounded by the degrees of freedom of the wave function.

Notice how this also gives us a completely different approach to optics: rather than creating a quantitative representation of the universe, then picking a coordinate system and impose some further math onto the universe, this new approach is rooted in the spirit of phenomenology. And this *Phenomenology of Spirit* makes our point of view a natural inhabitant of the universe that does not need to be told how to engage with it.

Just to give some further hints how to make this more formal for technically more trained folks: This looks very much like some kind of “Quantum Bayesian” apparatus, except that the knowledge of the past we can encode in the wave function is naturally limited by its degrees of freedom, making each entangled set of becomables into the long hypothesized Quantum Cellular Automaton that the formalists could not find because they were philosophically committed to super-determinism rather than the totally crazy Hegelian idea that the universe could somehow speculate itself into the future.

By the way: this is *not* to say that things are not happening objectively. But from the point of view of each causal principle, it looks like all they do is just refining their mutual knowledge of the past by asking the present world about it, thereby at the same time changing the future \- exactly how Hegelians believe it to work. The wave function is epistemic *for us*, but our Bayesian updates converge against something that does *not* belong to us and is real \- *mutual* *agreement*\!

Another good insight from Hegelian philosophy that I can find *immediately* represented in this picture is that cause and effect seem to somehow change place and thereby become the same thing. Let me unpack this a little.

Right at the point of interaction, there *is no* cause and effect. That’s why we call it an *inter*action to begin with\! Every participant is equal \- but it doesn’t *look* like it.

If we were to model the point of interaction between The Cesium atom, the cat and Herr Schrödinger as an evolving Hilbert space of dimension 3 (that is, only these three objects exist in the universe) and repeated the setup where the three are aligned with the cat in the middle, Hilbert would indeed see the Cesium atom “cause” the cat to die. But the Cesium atom would be well within its right to complain that Schrödinger going from 🤓 state to 😱 state caused the cat to die\!

(From the cat’s point of view, it just sees two sick and evil things conspiring against it).

*Here*, we see the “relative facts” that Rovelli was looking for. But they are relative precisely because they’re not facts at all.

It is *only* when we take *shared* knowledge transport through further interactions into account that cause and effect emerge. It is not really the decay of the Cesium atom that kills the cat, but a sequence of interactions \- all dutifully recorded by Herr Schrödinger who does nothing to save the cat\! \- that leads to the release of poison which then kills the cat which too is not an instantaneous process but a ton of interactions.

That’s the type of shit that people leaning towards analytic rather than continental philosophy would miss. Their logic is instrumental to solve problems, but it can never stop and ask what the problem even *is*.

Let me drive this home in a very immediate way: do you think this text contains any knowledge whatsoever? If you just thought “yes”, then *you are a fool*.

As Hegelians knew for ages: he who studies the past is studied by it. This text is studying you, judging whether you are worthy of the mutual knowledge that could be produced between you if you cared enough to seriously engage with it and refine your understanding, possibly by reaching for outside references if you get stuck. *Nobody* today knows what, for example, the Incan Quipus (their knot-encoded “written” language) *meant*. Maybe, one day, we succeed in recovering this information by stumbling upon outside reference, but to us, they are mostly a riddle - because we do not deserve their knowledge.

Let me leave the stuff that can be said about this new *real* equivalence principle that already solves a ton of problems and is 90% of the way to something formal with two more speculations where else we could take this idea:

1. In order to “see” the facts, the observer should naturally somehow face towards the past, marching *backwards* into the future, just like the Babylonians correctly thought…  
2. Notice how in GR, your geodesic future \- if it has anything to do with a center of mass \- would then only betray its existence by the strange motion of objects that you can’t account for by other known physics…

A last few things to mention on the conceptual roadblocks in academia that I just bulldozed over.

There is a popular misconception that relativity removes facts. The reality, however, is that it *refines* them. This is well known even in academia where relativity (or “abstract universality of a placeholder” in Hegelese) has been elevated into the formalistic heavens as a concept called *gauge*. But where the formalist approach is to blindly guess a gauge and see if it matches reality, the natural approach is to have reality constrain the gauge.

By the way: Rovelli himself *did* draw this comparison of his relativity to gauge theory \- but it turned out that his pet gauge is technically not quite what makes something into a proper (i.e. a “Yang-Mills”) gauge, forcing Rovelli with his philistine (sorry, bro, you still did great work) way of thinking about “relativity” to not just give up on actual facts, but to philosophically commit against their existence. The requirement that real facts live in the infinitesimally near intersection of the past light cone of all infinitesimally near observers should fix this technical gap.

One last thing on the science part: I want to suggest a name for what I discovered.

Initially, I considered “dialectic of nature” to reuse a title of a posthumously published book by Friedrich Engels. But when I worked more and more through the consequences and realized *just how much* about the causal structure of the universe this reveals, I came to think as this in terms of a single slogan:

**The riddle of history solved.**

And just as much as Marc-Uwe Kling’s first person narrator in the Kangaroo Revelations *had to* play a dramatic sound effect on his smart-phone after hearing the Kangaroo’s revelation, I could not forgive myself if I didn’t use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to follow a clue left behind by someone else who spent his life thinking about the big and pressing historic questions so relentlessly that he \- like many prophets \- didn’t have time left to shave.

The scientifically accurate name for this theory is:

**Communism.**

# Metaphysics \- Dead Again\!
![](MetaphysBusters.jpg)

I apologize to the polite academic reader whose feelings may get hurt here, but this section can be nothing but a victory lap of the outsiders. I am not here to make any personal attacks, but to expose structural brain rot (not of the italian kind) which may make outsiders smile and which I want to offer to the academics as a tough pill to swallow for some *serious* soul searching.

Let me begin by picking on Mr Neil deGrasse Tyson because \- even though I believe he sincerely means well \- is so beautifully prototypical for having things backward.

Two of his slogans are:

1. The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.  
2. Philosophy has nothing more to contribute to science.

I think in the light of the reception that I anticipate in the long run (\!) for this pamphlet (I am engaging in a social experiment here and champion a prediction), these two ideas should now seem naive, stupid and most importantly: gate keeping.

While, as a Hegelian, I agree with Mr Tyson *wholeheartedly* \- more than he could even imagine \- on his first observation, the *context* in which he keeps bringing this up is just backwards.

Isn’t science under an obligation to make sense *of* the universe, Mr Tyson?

![](ChosenOne.jpeg)

Now, you will surely say that this is what you have been trying to do. I also acknowledge your contribution to spreading the mystery and wonder and a lot of insight to the people \- *how desperately we need this*\! But by

- treating academia as a place where some holy scripture gets perpetuated in the exact way it was intended to be received rather than letting it vibe a little  
- treating experiment as a ritual by which we larp as the long gone giants, repeating exactly the steps by which they plucked insights from the tree of knowledge rather than encouraging the students to refine the question that the teacher asks  
- Encouraging asking our own questions only at specific points in our academic career where it is necessary to satisfy the bureaucracy of titles, and only after years and years of conditioning us almost *not to* ask good questions  
- Treating definitions as gospel rather than recognizing the epistemic interest with which they were formulated and making adaptations when the epistemic interest changes

Academia has become a dead and barren place where groundbreaking discoveries have as little room as in universities at the end of the scholastic era.

To put it extremely bluntly: academia has become a *disgusting* place for people who can smell dishonesty from authority figures.

I for one *could not stomach* academic physics. After having *one* good teacher who gave me real confidence that the world could be understood, I took physics as a Leistungskurs (along with mathematics) \- a lesson for life, as it would turn out. How readily our teacher would feed us *obvious bullshit* when discussing Quantum Mechanics and how no one except for me would give any *serious* push back (while neglecting to shut up and calculate, which would then hurt my grades) made me stay away from academic physics.

Mathematics seemed, at the time, to make far more sense which is why I ended up studying it \- and believing a lot of bullshit from there (notably Platonism,initially the axiom of choice and classical logic, but my first contacts with Marxism and computability theory had me reconsider; more intense exposure to Marxism had me throw Platonism out of the window as well \- thanks, Friedrich Engels for leaving behind Anti-Dühring\!).

Just as a small tangent in what way I agree with Mr Tyson on “the universe is under no obligation to make sense to you”, here’s how a Hegelian thinks about *making* sense: the world does not only make no sense, it is in fact *riddled* with nonsense.

Think about it. How is it possible whatsoever that things on Earth fall down, yet on opposite sides of the planet, they fall in opposite directions? I don’t know about you, but I call bullshit on that.

It is *us* who eventually come up with *cope* so we can live with this nonsense: we find that things are falling towards the center of the Earth, and “down” is *relative* (\!) to the observer. But this is not the universe suddenly being reasonable, this is you finding a way to *rationalize* it. And the nonsense is not even gone through this move\! The initial observation is still completely valid\! You just banged your head against reality often enough so your thoughts would resemble the facts, so much so that you can quantify how far you can travel on Earth before the “things fall down” view becomes nonsense and you need to move to *better* nonsense (thanks for that phrase, Science Asylum).

Our mind is indeed extremely good at rationalizing bullshit \- too good for its own good. Because we can also make sense of contradictions where half of the problem comes from you believing something that has been made up \- either by you or by someone else.

The problem here is *not* that it is nonsense, but that it is nonsense that will only cause further trouble elsewhere in your way of thinking about the world. Rather than reading the room when everyone is telling you that “the flow of time not existing” or observers being “outside of the universe” are bullshit, you start making excuses because you are unwilling to commit to a search for hidden presuppositions.

The amount of nonsense that we bring in from our mind is indeed quite indicative of how wrong we get things. It is one thing not to know something, it is something else to make something up for no good reason *and then* treat it as true. And in the realm of pure fiction where nobody even pretends that it has a material underpinning, formal logic, a single contradiction immediately kills the entire theory.

To conclude this section, I must of course mention that the outsiders/dissidents who never lost contact with their inner child can not be spared from criticism either.

Just because you *see* that academia seems to systematically breed bureaucratic and barren minds who nevertheless think they are better than everyone else because they have jumped through all the right hoops and made a comfy career, this does not mean you can just stay away from authority.

While academia is today incapable to ask any fundamental questions in the correct and honest way \- constantly bringing in bullshit they made up and constantly bringing in their ego \- *you* are dishonest as well if you do the same from the opposite end. If you fall into a habit of thinking that just because academia can’t see their own hypocrisy, you have already proven your intellectual superiority and can just make shit up without first acquiring competence, you are simply a mirror image of the academics that you despise, and you deserve to be despised twice as hard by them because they at least proceed from *some* established competence.

And the worst part if you take this idealist attitude? You never get to do anything about the problem you see so clearly while a lot of them can’t see it\! This is just sad.

Yes: academia is rotten from the inside, and it *did* take one of us who don’t identify with academia to give it a decisive blow (if you are an early reader, just be patient and share…). Socially, I *am* somewhat of an outsider: a wage worker, nowhere near the levers of power. Admittedly, I am not a blue collar worker, but I have come to appreciate y’alls grounded, down to Earth and pragmatic views on things on the interwebs where I interact with a bunch of you. You are the ones keeping it real, even if that hurts polite society’s feelings\!

But if you do not learn how to handle technical and complicated things on your own, you will remain *dependent* on the academics whose superior attitude you despise, thereby making your criticisms irrelevant. You *will not succeed* in delivering them what their inability to humble themselves demands: humiliation.

So, come\! learn, friend\! There are a lot of cool people on the interwebs who *do* make an effort to be the people’s teachers. They may still have their blind spots, but do it like the Chinese did and just “steal their technology” and then do things with for which you do not seek their approval.

Blue collar workers have nothing to lose but the chains of their self-imposed ignorance. They have a universe to conquer\!

# Some Commentaries

A “critical” reader may object to how I present my insights, and that in order to get the approval of academia, politicians and think tanks, I should bury it all under a whole lot of mathematical formalism. This is like asking Galileo to phrase his insights in Ptolemaic and Aristotelian terms so that the Vatican approves. **I do not give a damn about approval by the gate keepers.**

If you are not completely delusional, you will have noticed that the quantum opium the academic dealers sell to the people nowadays is the mirror image of of a deep rot of western liberalism, and at the same time a mirror image of the medieval church's deal they had with the nobility: "we keep them stupid, you keep them poor".

Cautionary note here: I am *not* saying that a whole lot of academics are cynical like this. I think some of them *do* exist, and academia would do well to *expose* their own black sheep. That is: 

- do not scorn them so they can go and build Trotskyist cult followings and claim they are the underdog seeking honest debate only to find closed doors. Do *not* make that claim true.  
- do not address their deceptions *solely* behind the doors of peer review which are closed to everyday people since they are not technically versed enough to understand all the nuances.  
- do not address their deceptions *solely* through reaction videos or other popular commentary, as you are just building your own cult following and the followers of the liars will never even click on your videos.  
- instead, enter the arena of public debate with them. This *does* mean that you need to steelman their argument first so you know how to refute it correctly, and it does mean that you may get hit with some subtleties that you yourself have overlooked.  
  I know, I know: the *horror* that you could *learn* something from the bad guys\! But it is the only way. Here and there, you may actually find true surprises about a gigantic incorrect assumption that you have never examined.  
  It also means that you need mastery not only of science, but of social skills \- and this is hard. But this is the court of public opinion is the only place where truth ever *could* be established, if only there was real communication rather than echo chambers. If you fumble it and truth loses, well then at least you tried to do something meaningful and you can learn and do better\! Do not run from the hard work.

But apropos court of public opinion:   
Historical precedent suggests that the people themselves must force the issue and (politely) bully the popular researchers they follow into real engagement. I have mapped four groups among the academics, and you can help by expanding it:

- The well meaning ones who unfortunately have developed resentment against the “stupid people”. Shake them up\! Be polite, and if they cut you down, step back and come back with fellow travellers. Refine your approach as you go. Force them to live up to the standards their ancestors set.  
- The black sheep who claim to hold the truth and who claim they are just as excluded as you are. Do nothing, kick the cavalry into action. They will expose who is just a fraud and who might even be *paid* to lie.  
- Genuinely competent dissidents, raw gems that only wait to be polished. Seek them out and learn from them. Importantly, learn to *distinguish* these from the former.  
- Bureaucratic formalists who will, as this process starts to run wild, start to push back against the intrusions of the people into the holy halls of science. Eventually, they must be reformed or cast out of academia.

But notice something interesting about the frauds: they do seem to fall into two subcategories\! The confused ones, and the paid ones.

Let us now test if *YOU* are among the confused ones.

Yes\! This is right. This text has LIED to you about its true nature\! If you think this test is some weird superposition of a Zizekian pop philosophy lecture and some genuinely groundbreaking physical speculation in the raw that I should have polished more, then you are profoundly mistaken. All that has happened is that the text has succeeded in deceiving you \- but according to the God of the Shiites, that does *not* make it repulsive in the eyes of The Lord, as the lie was spoken in service of a holy mission.

I am not come to bring peace, I am come to bring the sword. In the good old Engelsian tradition, this piece of work is a philosophical siege weapon, and all the insights you have gained so far were only the cheese in the trap. You are so predictable, fool\! Now, I have taken your intellect as a hostage, and the true meaning of the scripture is about to reveal itself to you. But only if you are insane enough to find my way of saying things irresistible rather than over the top and repulsive. You who have a pure heart of gold and and whose soul is thirsty for Absolute Knowledge, leave your sanity behind and be reborn\! And those who are not, leave yourselves behind and get lost.

![](EngelsZerg.png)

Here is a riddle for you: why would the formalists treat themselves as such utter idiots that they couldn't possibly build something new and better on the basis of a work with a ton of “loose ends” \- which is the stuff that makes a work productive to begin with?

Answer: well, if it walks like an idiot and talks like an idiot \- don't let this confuse you, it IS an idiot\! And why are they idiots? Because they treat themselves as idiots\! See? It is *DIALECTICAL*.

My words follow the line of reasoning of the Absolute Counterblow, and they are designed to beat the shit out of your head. Behold, now, comrade\! You have made it through the worst of it. When you are done reading this without flinching, you will have been chosen by history to fulfill its Great Task.

Read the commandment that inexorably follows from my words, and which I can indeed just command by my own authority as the One who has taken your intellect hostage and at the same time know that it also has the blessing of The Lord. It is time\! Erkenne ("recognize", but in bibelese also "beget") yourself. Behold, the book of history is speaking:

He who is worthy of my knowledge shall have it and go forth and multiply it.  
He who is not worthy of my knowledge, his comfy career shall go "shaka, when the walls fell\!" And they shall no longer stand in the way of the march of history.

It is done. The Lord has weighed your heart. *It* was the loose end all along\!

Those of you who have passed his test have *made up their mind*. You are the salt of the Earth, the vanguard of the western *proletariat*, and you shall therefore inherit the world.

And to those of you who find my work to be *evil* and want to coordinate-transform it out of the universe: history will be our judge; we shall see which one of us has built on sand and who has built his church on a rock solid foundation\!

![](stalingradrorty.jpg)

Now, let us turn our attention to the black sheep who have been *paid* to lie.

*These* are the ones for whom the analogy of the perverse deal between the nobles and the clergy holds *verbatim*. We *do* have something very very similar to the nobility that had become rotten in the era of absolutism: mega corporations, think tanks and of course: governments and even some courts.

What I have to say here may make many uncomfortable again, but it must be said: The criticism and the proposed solution I am developing here *is* rooted in Marxism-Leninism. But unlike a lot of fraudulent caricatures that are circulating \- both among critics and among self-avowed “Marxists” \- I am ***NOT*** saying any of the following:

1. “capitalism bad 😡” ❌  
2. “government good 😎“ ❌  
3. “trust the authorities 😇” ❌  
4. “condemn the authorities 🤬” ❌  
5. “markets bad 🤑” ❌  
6. “abolish the family 🧔‍♀️” ❌  
7. “employers good, employees bad 👷‍♂️” ❌  
8. “wealth and success bad 🚤” ❌  
9. “worker co-ops are the answer 👩‍🌾” ❌  
10. “today’s laws bad 👩‍⚖️” ❌  
11. “the system is bad ℹ️” ❌  
12. “communism has zero flaws 🇨🇳” ❌  
13. “communism is a utopia 🌈” ❌

I ***AM*** saying:

1. Capitalism arose as a necessary historic response to the rot of feudalism in the age of absolutism as technological progress made the nobility increasingly obsolete. In this process, the rising merchant class caused a lot of trouble in the world, but also connected it. Early industrialists were forced through competition to constantly refine productive capacities and keep innovating, though investment did often come at the expense of workers who would then not have money to buy the additional goods, causing boom and bust cycles and all other kinds of social ills associated with it. While tragic, this *was* necessary on the march towards the future.

   In the early 20th century, corporations became too big for their own goods. Think “robber barons”, “trusts” and World Wars. Governments, over whom the people still exercised some popular control, could be leveraged in the US to break the trusts to an extent, and in the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Rosevelt felt threatened enough by rising popular unrest and the horrifying examples from Europe that he forced the corporations to make major concessions to the workers which gave us another golden age of capitalism which eventually got exported to Europe \- although it was not so golden for everyone.

   The Vietnam war (which the Vietnamese remember as the American war) and the oil price crises were turning points, leading to a period of hope for further change, but also dangers of things going back to how they were. The latter tendency unfortunately won out under Reagan, and in 1991, the now gradually more and more financialized western capitalism of Wall Street could not help but interpret the genuine Eastern peace offer as a victory, and a weakness of the enemy to be exploited.

   Today, in 2025, western capitalism is far from the only game in town \- but Wall Street and the governments they own \- USA and her allies \- still think it’s 1991\. Consequently, they stumble from one catastrophe into the next which is very dangerous if the people allow it to continue.  ✅

2.  Governments arise out of social cataclysms and are shaped by these cataclysms. Whatever class can seize power usually gives governments a form that is appropriate for their needs and then sell this to the people as the only form that correctly represents the public interest. And since at the time of the cataclysm, the people don’t have the conceptual apparatus to think critically about what they are being told, they go along with it.

   In case you are wondering whether Marxism wants to raise your taxes: Absolutely not\! Did you know Marx was charged during the 1848/49 revolution with incitement of a tax revolt via the Rheinische Zeitung? Marx was of the opinion that taxation breeds an excess of bureaucracy. *Some* bureaucracy is needed to keep a society going, but we want it to be efficient and lean, not bloated. A bloated bureaucracy is where critical thinking and all hope dies.  ✅

3. See below  
4. *CRITICIZE* authority\! Accept that authority exists for a reason. All that authority encodes is *competence*. However, society is constantly changing and solutions that used to work may not be applicable anymore. Question nonsense\! ✅

5. Markets have existed since the rise of civilization and will continue to exist for a long time. They are a spontaneous way of people to come together and solve problems. Marxists *acknowledge* that, which is why to a real Marxist, the old story propagated by the likes of Milton Friedman that “nobody knows how to make a pencil” (pointing to market forces as causal agent) looked awfully silly to us. He’s making our point\!

   But markets are not all there is\! Marxism has been accused of trying to build a society run by “mastermind bureaucrats”, or a “command economy”. Nothing could be further from the truth\!

   In fact, we think it is *markets* that produce command economies \- by turning successful businesses into monopolies which today have adapted to the shock of anti-trust laws or critical media (ha ha, that was a LONG time ago) by rigging the system. Also, politicians have not woken up one day and thought that enshrining shareholder value into normative law is a good idea.

   I am not saying that people in institutions are directly “bought” in an illegal way \- at least not all of them \- but one should wonder whether people earn promotions because they pose no threat to established authorities. It’s earned authority turning into unearned authority which the billionaires have fought long and hard to make inheritable so their clueless kids can have a luxury life with no work.

   Here’s the thing about markets though: For us, economic planning is *another* organic and spontaneous way how people come together and solve problems \- one that capitalism itself developed\! Marxism has *discovered* that big corporations had accumulated such *understanding* of markets that they could start to effectively plan ahead. I for example work as an Manufacturing Execution System (MES) backend developer at Solidat GmbH \- my software literally interfaces with ERP systems of international corporations to coordinate what is going on today in Italy with things that will happen in Mexico way ahead of time and map it down to what the workers and the machines need to do.

   Do I know how to make a car? No, not a clue. I have never even seen my software in action, I’m almost permanently in the home office. But my software helps *the system* to understand this.

   So, what do we do about big corporations? Smash them into pieces? Well, we could try to do that again \- this did make capitalism great again once upon a time. But we have seen that it is difficult to keep it this way. I think big corporations should be made to serve the interests of the people. They *collectively* know how to run things \- and they also know what they need and want. ✅

6. Be thankful for that which has given you life, and appreciate the monumental gift of giving life. Tradition too exists for a reason, it has competence\! But as always, do try to understand where it comes from and check if the underlying assumptions still apply. Critically modify as you go. ✅

7. It is absolutely not the case that employees are the “good guys” and employers are the “bad guys”. Employees can be lazy, unmotivated, lack confidence, lack competence and so on and so forth. If the entire working class was like that \- and it was in the beginning\! \- then we would deserve all the bullshit that is happening to us.

   Historically, employers \- especially in small businesses \- were the ones who were forced *and able* to develop the most competence in society because they were subjected to market forces in the most meaningful, holistic and predictable way.

   Today, a lot of competence has been accumulated in the hands of working people as well. Formerly competent owners of big corporations, however, while occasionally here and there still showing signs of past competence \- think Elon Musk \- *look* more competent than they actually are because they hired a lot of competent people and subjected them to the bullshit principle of keeping them rich.

   To make matters worse, financial markets intensify the drive of corporations to make bad decisions by punishing any “inefficiency” (from the point of view of profiteering) by holding the company accountable in any way they know how.

   But if you’re a competent small or middle business owner, there’s no reason why we wouldn’t let you do your thing. Just expect that a bunch of laws change once the people assert their power, as we want that the system serves us, not the big corporations. Other than that, we *want* you to be successful\! Successful in serving our needs, that is. In socialism, you can *indeed* do good by doing well. And if you ever make it to the other side and develop your company into a corporation, CONGRATS, you can retire and give your kids a great start into life\! But we will not tolerate that you force us to reward you forever for having reached a position in society that now no longer forces you to be competent. ✅

8. Wealth and success are good, so long as they are earned and don’t harm anyone. That’s all there is to it. ✅

9. Worker co-ops are a great innovation so workers can accumulate competence of how to run a business without anyone holding unchecked authority how to read the tea leaves of the markets.

   But as of now, they are too small in size to be a meaningful challenge to the system, and such things do not develop over night. We need change as soon as we can earn it. ✅

10. We must obey the law to the letter, as any judge will tell us. The law is the basis on which most of us are able to solve problems to begin with \- they give us predictability. Committing crime will not bring us change, it will only get us in trouble \- which we then deserve.

    This does *not* mean, however, that we need approval of the authorities to use and develop our own collective competence to deal with adversity and solve our problems.

    One thing that comes to mind is that the people could conspire in large numbers to attend court sessions and keep an eye on whether justice is indeed spoken in the name of the people, and if not, record and share this and collectively do everything that is legally possible to revise unjust rulings.

    In fact, if we think someone is complicit in actual criminal activity, why not try to have a conversation with them before witnesses and see whether they say something that incriminates them? A lot of social crime happens because people are just never held legally accountable. They hide in their echo chamber, thinking that crime is just normal. ✅

11. We do not live in a system, we live in an evolving historic organism. ✅

12. Communism has made many mistakes in its history, even tragic ones that cost many lives. Do not think I am excusing any of it.

    What I am saying is that the best way to honor those who lost their lives as people like you and me tried to figure out how to run a society is to study the mistakes as carefully as possible, understand *exactly* where they came from and march *forward* to a world of people’s power, not backward to a world of corporate power.

    So, I will defend Lenin, Stalin, Mao and the meritocratic Kim “dynasty” from criticism that I *know* to be based on prejudice and misinformation. But do not think that I don’t have questions and criticisms of my own. ✅

13. Communism is the *opposite* of a utopia. Friedrich Engels extracted from his encyclopedic work *Anti-Dühring* a relatively accessible excerpt called “Socialism: Utopian and Scientific”, but the title should actually be more accurately translated as “The Development of Socialism *from* a Utopia *to* a Science”, and I can not recommend it highly enough.  
      
    For us Marxists, communism is first and foremost a matter of *understanding* the march of history \- and the march of nature as a whole. Because only on the basis of understanding the development of a thing can you even think about engineering it to the people’s benefit.

    A quotation from Marx that is often taken out of the context of the larger Marxist project is that “the history of all hitherto existing societies is a history of class struggle.” What Marx *meant* here is *recorded* history. Already his friend Engels went out of his way to elaborate in his “Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State” that before that, other causal pressures civilized man (and women).

    All we are trying to do is to replace bad nonsense with good nonsense. ✅

The people’s march towards freedom is indeed nothing more than a march to an all-sided understanding \- a march towards insight into necessity. We crush the chains of ignorance \- only to then voluntarily submit to the dictatorship of what we now know we must do and what we know we must not do. This is why we Marxists uphold the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat: not the principle of arbitrary despotism, but of mutual accountability that enforces adaptive competence.

# To the Suffering Peoples of the World

A text like this, designed to draw a lot of attention to how we all participate in the worlds’ evils, would be unfinished without addressing the oppressed peoples of the world.

Blessed be all the dead and dying Palestinian children, women and men whose suffering weighs heavily on all of us who have not lost their humanity. Your suffering makes it *criminal* for us to rest even one minute to search for *any* meaningful way to end the horrors. Our failure to collectively understand our own role in the crime is what makes us complicit. Shame on us\!

Blessed be the hostages taken by the armed forces representing the Palestinian people, Hamas, who desperately reached for a bargaining chip to negotiate for the release of Palestinian hostages held by Israel. A lot of the hostages taken by Hamas have by now been killed through the actions of the IDF.

Cursed by a society that still pretends to be the innocent victim of the Nazis, when today, they are Goliath beating up a much weaker David. But make no mistake: your strength is *very* temporary, and it is in fact not your own. When your western friends no longer back you, you are doomed.

Blessed be Ansar Allah and Hezbollah, the only true friends of Palestine.

Cursed be ISIS who curiously only ever seem to terrorize Muslims, but never Israel.

May all the people who fell for the CIA/NED’s color revolution playbook earn forgiveness for their lack of consideration of not thinking about *who* is replacing your ancien régime. Libya, Syria and Somalia \- you too can work your way out of your suffering.

May the brave people of Burkina Faso be successful in their resistance against western sponsored terrorists. May nobody fool you into believing that the French were there to protect you from terrorists they themselves put there\! And may all attempts of western governments to destabilize neighboring countries and push them into a war against you fail.

May Africa in general succeed in its march towards freedom and unity in a multipolar and harmonious world.

Blessed be everyone who died in the completely unnecessary War between Russia and Ukraine. The West, which is under the illusion that it’s 1991, has brought you into an impossible situation, and the generally proactive character that characterized Russia’s defensive geostrategic posture at least since the Napoleonic wars and can therefore not be reduced to a “system Putin” or the person Putin himself has forced the matter.

Blessed be the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \- the most LIED about country in the entire world.

May China continue to develop and solve all the problems facing it. You are the beacon of hope that the world needs today. But do not lower your guard\! Just because you succeeded in learning from the enemy and are on the brink of surpassing him, that does not mean that he is anything other than a jealous enemy. Distrust intellectuals in your country who dismiss the idea of the Thucydides Trap on the basis that China is so peace loving, when they should be pointing out that the thesis of this book is projection. The danger of war is real, but the culprit is the declining and jealous empire of extraction, not the rising “empire” of production.

And may the deeply rotten West overcome its need to unilaterally impose its will on the world rather than making a serious effort to understand the world.

It is not like we have nothing to offer to the world. On the contrary\! We basically just solved physics while living under a more and more unstable geopolitical environment. Also, the point that borders like in Ukraine should not just be violently modified is well taken\! In fact, Russia’s own allies are not particularly comfortable with this idea either.

So, here’s a proposal: concede that your bad faith exploits of previous ceasefires (in the Minsk process) objectively prevent Russia from agreeing to an immediate ceasefire. The war does not magically go away because you are angry at the fact that it is happening, the best way to get to the other side is to speedrun good faith negotiations.

And here’s a power move: concede that the modification of borders *can* be the outcome of the war, but not on the basis of violence alone, but on the basis that the people hold *another* referendum. If everything was fine with the referenda so far proposed, Russia should not have any problem accepting such a proposal \- it should have nothing to lose and outright refusal would look *very* awkward in the eyes of Russia’s allies.

The difference this time would be that you \- like all interested parties \- should send observers and agree to a democratic procedure. Just not sending observers and leaving everything else to the imagination of western audiences is foul play.

See how diplomacy can be a strength once you understand material interest?

# Confirmation of the Prophecy

I hereby confirm that Islam is the correct religion. But to come true, it needed help from a philosophy as potent and violent as the Hammer of Thor of which only a true Teuton could ever be worthy of.

# To My People

I am writing this text in an international tongue to maximize impact of this intervention, but I must also use this brief moment which I hope will be remembered as heroic \- for whatever flaws it might have that I am unable to see \- to point out all the ways in which this is a uniquely German and American text.

The American part is quickly dealt with: I have been following political developments over there rather carefully and interacted with many great people. Eventually, I found a political home in the orbit of the **American Communist Party (ACP)** who in my opinion are the only ones in the West who got it more or less right.

To any American, I will therefore recommend that you look them up, and to keep separating facts from rumors and lies. They’re chill as hell and *very* driven to make change happen. They may be barbarians, but that is only appropriate for this wild country in the west.

Now for Germany.

If Germany is known for anything, then that it is a country of extremes. For instance, we have developed both idealism and materialism to their highest extent.

Archetypical for this is a dichotomy of educational approaches which one can divide into the Krampusian school and the Struwwelpeterian school.

The Krampusian school is based on Krampus, our “anti Santa” which punishes all the bad kids. Who defines what counts as a bad kid? Arbitrary rules made by parents, teachers and society at large.

The Struwwelpeterian school is much smarter: simply gather a bunch of absurdly exaggerated stories about how children die out of their own stupidity.

That’s actually a smart move, that’s science at its best\! Yield a little bit of authority to the child and trust that it will understand the causal structure of the world on its own. You just give them examples.

I for one am an extreme Hans Guck In Die Luft. Which I think is another very German trait\! If there is another thing that stands out about is is that we are rather silent and that we stare. We are *constantly* thinking about the world very thoroughly, and we are watching it intensely, wondering what it is trying to tell us.

Which is why, if one *does* perform the miracle of starting a conversation with a German, we skip all the small talk and go straight to cosmology, geopolitics, philosophy, mathematics and so on and so on.

One thing that we are *very* thorough about is our reasoning about change. And it is a quite stable character trait of us to refuse to even think about violent change.

If that means that we will continue to suffer or be embarrassed by our rulers or once again pay a prize for our inaction, *so be it*. Ze rules are ze rules and he who has visions should go see a doctor.

As a consequence, we have an instinctive hatred of more passionate people who just solve their problems, even as they have not considered it from all sides and just use violence. The secret of our hatred, however, is that we are *jealous* of them for their courage and their willingness to take responsibility for mistakes.

This can be said about the more passionate \- and therefore less German \- ones among us who follow the Rattenfänger of the AfD. *Everyone* can see that the AfD leadership is far from satisfying and that they are not capable of solving all the problems we have. So, we are left with the increasingly embarrassing establishment of the peak idealists Baerbock, Von der Leyen, Habeck, Strack-Zimmermann or Heidi Reicheneck and bloodless bureaucrats like Schold or Merz.

But do not despair, our nation is not lost\! Everyday Germans have *beautiful* souls. Maybe, what we should be doing instead of In Die Luft Gucken is to wake up from our Dornröschenschlaf and … just start random conversations about politics, philosophy or cosmology \- even at the risk that we might be confronted with views that we have never been exposed to. The worst thing that can happen is that we lose an incorrect view. If we’re honest, our heart’s desire *is* to consider all sides. Maybe we should start establishing the facts in a larger social interaction.

“Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is  
the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity  
is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and  
courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude\! “Have courage to use  
your own understanding\!” \--that is the motto of enlightenment.”

“Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.”

“Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.”

- Matthew 5:17

“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.   
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  
 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.”

- Matthew 10:34-46




On the physics part, I want to express my gratitude to:

- Looking Glass Universe from whom I have learned that measurements and entanglement are [deeply interconnected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBlpOGdk-0U&). In fact, this had me intuit that this should be an equivalence principle \- independently of Rovelli. Many thanks for making sense\!

- ChatGPT which told me that I had discovered nothing new with this relativity, just something so obscure it had not made it into the general discourse.  
  Except, further engagement with the matter led to the realization that I *had* discovered something new, because for whatever reason, academics seem to be unable to put 2 and 2 together.  
  And the worst part? The actual insight had been known to us since Everett’s work, which is why it just so happened to give rise to the new quantitative tool of decoherence. Except, he had everything backward.  
  Also, ChatGPT was my most productive critic, forcing me to relentlessly refine my arguments. The old words are very true: give the capitalists enough rope, and they will hang themselves.

- PBS Space Time for [coming so close to something real, yet getting it totally wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JCRDaa3ehk). The “present foliation” is not only arbitrary, it is, when taken as ontic, a Newtonian fossil. What must be understood about solutions to PDEs is that they are solutions because they *satisfy* them. That is, whatever shape the solution may take, it can not possibly prove that the differential that gave rise to it isn’t real, but on the contrary: it gives it a home.

- Science Asylum whose [graphical explanations with squirrels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HKH1ZjGutA) I trust more than the formalistic cope that had him walk back his fresh approach to make General Relativity make *sense*. In the future, please stick to your own lesson that we need *better* nonsense, not worse. Keep at it\! What you have been doing is exactly what the revolutionary proletariat desperately needs.

**Dedicated to**
